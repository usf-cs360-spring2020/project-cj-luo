Make an account with ANES and download both the [ANES Timeseries Cumulative Data File](http://www.electionstudies.org/studypages/anes_timeseries_cdf/anes_timeseries_cdf.htm) (1948-2012), and the [2016 Timeseries Data](http://www.electionstudies.org/studypages/anes_timeseries_2016/anes_timeseries_2016.htm).  Extract both the zipped files, then you can access them using the relative path defined in the Jupyter notebook.
